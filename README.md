## Projects

### JnU_eLibrary

*Dec 2019 - Mar 2020*

JnU_eLibrary was an android-based mobile application program designed to digitalise the central library of Jagannath University, Dhaka-1100. This project was instructed by our honourable teacher, Dr. Sajeeb Saha. With my teammate, Sudipta Kumar Mondol, I have completed this project. We designed this project based on the central library management authority's needs & focusing on their existing problems.

In this project, my tasks included:

1. Discussing with central library employees and students to identify their problems
2. Designing solutions for the identified problems in collaboration with my teammate
3. Testing the application and identifying any bugs
4. Checking the source code and helping teammates fix any issues
5. Collecting resources for the application

We worked together remotely and always communicated with each other while doing our jobs.
