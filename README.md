## Projects

### JnU_eLibrary
*Dec 2019 - Mar 2020*

JnU_eLibrary was an android-based mobile application program designed to digitalise the central library of Jagannath University, Dhaka-1100. This project was instructed by our honourable teacher, Dr. Sajeeb Saha. With my teammate, Sudipta Kumar Mondol, I have completed this project. We designed this project based on the central library management authority's needs & focusing on their existing problems.

In this project, my tasks were:

- Discussing with central library employees and students to identify their problems
- Designing solutions for the identified problems in collaboration with my teammate
- Testing the application and identifying any bugs
- Checking the source code and helping teammates fix any issues
- Collecting resources for the application

We worked together remotely and always communicated with each other while doing our jobs. The source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Redwan-CSE/JnU_eLibrary).

### CSenthusiastBD - Discord Bot for Server Management and Moderation.

CSenthusiastBD is a powerful Discord bot that can effectively monitor discord messages, manage members, send welcome messages, generate server logs, and perform most of the moderation tasks in our server. Created by me, this bot has been specifically designed to meet the needs of the CS Enthusiast community, and it's available exclusively for our private Discord server.

With CSenthusiastBD, we can easily monitor messages and activities in our server, and keep it safe from spammers, trolls, and other undesirable elements. The bot can be easily configured to send welcome messages to new members, and also to manage roles and permissions. The bot can also generate detailed server logs, which can help us keep track of the activities of our members. Moreover, CSenthusiastBD is highly customizable and can be easily integrated with your existing Discord server. Source code is currently in private repo.

### Cyber Security Related Projects:

I have done several shell, powershell and python projects to automate my task. They are currently in private repo because I use them to test my clients' security. Maybe in the future I will share some public resources.
