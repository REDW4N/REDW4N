# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

"Hello, I'm Md. Redwan Ahmed, a cybersecurity analyst, penetration tester, and OSINT analyst from Bangladesh. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Jagannath University, Dhaka, which provided me with foundational skills in the field of cybersecurity. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Jagannath University, Dhaka.

In addition, I have completed several courses to further develop my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity. Some of these courses were free, while others were paid and provided me with certifications. These courses equipped me with the knowledge and tools to identify and address security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.

As a penetration tester, I simulate attacks on computer systems and networks to identify weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. I am also experienced in conducting OSINT investigations, which involve gathering and analyzing information from publicly available sources to uncover potential security threats.

Currently, I am actively seeking remote/freelance opportunities in the field of cybersecurity. I am passionate about helping organizations and individuals protect their sensitive information and assets from cyber threats and am eager to put my skills and knowledge to work in a dynamic and challenging environment.

If you're looking for a dedicated, detail-oriented cybersecurity professional who is committed to staying up-to-date on the latest security trends and best practices, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Follow me to learn more about my experience and skills in the field of cybersecurity."

## Projects

### JnU_eLibrary
*Dec 2019 - Mar 2020*

JnU_eLibrary was an android-based mobile application program designed to digitalise the central library of Jagannath University, Dhaka-1100. This project was instructed by our honourable teacher, Dr. Sajeeb Saha. With my teammate, Sudipta Kumar Mondol, I have completed this project. We designed this project based on the central library management authority's needs & focusing on their existing problems.

In this project, my tasks were:

- Discussing with central library employees and students to identify their problems
- Designing solutions for the identified problems in collaboration with my teammate
- Testing the application and identifying any bugs
- Checking the source code and helping teammates fix any issues
- Collecting resources for the application

We worked together remotely and always communicated with each other while doing our jobs. The source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Redwan-CSE/JnU_eLibrary).
